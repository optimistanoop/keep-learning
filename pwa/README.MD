## Hello PWA 

Here are the list of docs found helpful while doing PWA.

### What a service worker can do:-

* **Improve performance of your application/site**
Caching resources (files) will make content load faster under most network conditions.

* **Make your app "offline-first"**
Using the Fetch API inside a service worker, we can intercept network requests and then modify the response with content other than the requested resource.

* **Act as the base for advanced features**
Service workers provide the starting point for features that make web applications work like native apps. Some of these features are:

* **Notifications API:**
A way to display and interact with notifications using the operating system's native notification system.
* **Push API:**
An API that enables your app to subscribe to a push service and receive push messages. 
* **Background Sync API:**
Lets you defer actions until the user has stable connectivity.
* **Channel Messaging API:**
Lets web workers and service workers communicate with each other and with the host application. Examples of this API include new content notification and updates that require user interaction.
