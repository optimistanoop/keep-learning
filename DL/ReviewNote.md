## Review Note

* This is a good start. :thumbsup: You submission shows that you have a good understanding of GAN. Please check my comments on 
  how to further improve your project and
  the performance of your model to generate realistic faces. To get some more intuition about GANs check this blog post . All the best for your next submission.

* Congratulations  :thumbsup:
  Your submission shows that you have a good understanding of GAN as this project's  generated faces are looking like realistic faces. Improving performance of the model is bit tricky and I hope suggestions given in comments will improve you learning as well as the performance of the model.
