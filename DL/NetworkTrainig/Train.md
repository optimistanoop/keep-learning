## Neural Network Training   
### The function train is implemented correctly.

* Good Job!!!
  * It has used all the required functions.
  * Output is shown using `show_generator_output`.
    This model generates realistic faces however I want you to thing about the impact on output increasing `batch_images`. Try training this model by increasing `batch_images`.

* Required: Most parts of the function is implemented perfectly however to improve training of the model I would suggest -
    * batch_images : Increasing batch_images can improve in optimizing d_opt.
    * I would suggest you to think about tnumpy.random.random and numpy.random.uniform for using it as z_input.
