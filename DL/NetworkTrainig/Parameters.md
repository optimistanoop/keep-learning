## Neural Network Training   
### The parameters are set reasonable numbers.

* Choosing reasonable parameters is always tough for model. Try adjusting `batch_size` in the range of 64 to 128.

* The hyperparameters are optimal. Well Done !!!

* Required: Choosing reasonable parameters is always tough for model. Try adjusting following parameters to produce realistic results -
  *  batch_size : Increase it to a range of 64 to 128.
  *  learning_rate : Decrease it to a range of 0.0003 to 0.0002
  *  beta1 : Slightly decrease the value around 0.4 to 0.5
